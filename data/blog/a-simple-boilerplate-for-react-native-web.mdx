Check out this simple boilerplate for integrating React Native for
Web in the React Native project. It includes minimal configs &
dependencies enough to get you started with React Native for Web.
It does not use “react-scripts” or is not bootstrapped from CRA,
so you don’t have to worry about ejecting & unnecessary configs,
dependencies, etc. Plus, it also supports hot module resolution HMR.
