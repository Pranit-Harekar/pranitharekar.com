Often times you come across a situation wherein you are running on an
old Xcode version while your physical device is running on a newer iOS
version which is not supported by Xcode. In such a situation, you need
to manually add device support files to the Xcode package so it can
smoothly build and run apps on a new iOS version.

<div className="flex flex-wrap -mx-2 overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  <div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">
    <Image
      alt="screenshot_missing_device_support_files"
      src="/static/images/screenshot_missing_device_support_files.png"
      width={800}
      height={250}
    />
  </div>
</div>

In order to add device support files,

## Step 1: Get device support files

There is no official source from where you can download device support files.
However, there is a community maintained GitHub repos or drives from where
you can download them. Here is one of them,

https://github.com/iGhibli/iOS-DeviceSupport/tree/master/DeviceSupport

So go ahead & download the device support files matching your required iOS
version. Its okay if you donâ€™t find exact version e.g. version 12.2 works
for 12.2.X

ðŸ’¡ NOTE: Sometimes Xcode does not recognize device support files, in that case,
make sure you rename device support filesâ€™ folder to match exact iOS version
that Xcode is looking for, e.g. in the screenshot above Xcode is looking
for iOS 12.2 (16E5191d) device support files, so make sure you include the
version along with build number in parenthesis.

## Step 2: Unzip & place files in Xcode package

Next, unzip the files & place them at following location,

```javascript
Applications >> Xcode >> Right Click >> Show Package Contents >> Contents
 >> Developer >> Platforms >> iPhoneOS.platform >> DeviceSupport
```

<div className="flex flex-wrap -mx-2 overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  <div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">
    <Image
      alt="screenshot_xcode_device_support_location"
      src="/static/images/screenshot_xcode_device_support_location.png"
      width={800}
      height={300}
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Step 3: Restart Xcode

In order for the above changes to take place, you need to restart the Xcode
& then use the device.

Thatâ€™s it! I hope these steps helped you and saved some of your precious time.
